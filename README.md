# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

Welcome to **MyReads**, a simple yet powerful book tracking application built with React! This app allows you to manage your reading lists, categorize books into different shelves, and search for new titles to add to your collection.

## Features
- **Browse Books**: View all the books in your collection, organized into three categories: "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," and "Read."
- **Search Functionality**: Find new books to add to your collection from a vast database. You can add books to any of the three shelves.
- **Shelf Management**: Easily move books between shelves to keep your reading organized.
- **Persistent Storage**: All your data is stored locally, so your books stay organized even after refreshing the page.
